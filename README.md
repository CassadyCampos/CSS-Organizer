CSS Stylesheet Organizer: Keep your external stylesheet clean files with this C++ script. 

Could I have spent the time it took to write this organizing my CSS files instead? 

Yes.

Am I solving a nonexistent-problem if you took the time to organize your stylesheets as you created them? 

Yes.

But, why should I worry about these things.
