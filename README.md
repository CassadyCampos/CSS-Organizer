CSS Stylesheet Organizer: Keep your external stylesheet clean files with this C++ script. 

Could I have spent the time it took to write this organizing my CSS files instead? 

Yes.

Am I solving a nonexistent-problem if you took the time to organize your stylesheets as you created them? 

Yes.

But, why should I worry about these things. 

Example:
Original code: 

.banana { 
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: space-around;


}
.apple{

    border: 1px solid red;
    color: green;

}

After executing:

.apple{
    border: 1px solid red;
    color: green;
}
.banana {
    align-items: space-around;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
}
